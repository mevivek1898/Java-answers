In programming, a data structure refers to a structured way of organizing data which facilitates efficient storage and retrieval.

Even though a user defined class such as Person allows for storing data in a structured manner, when we use the term data structures, we usually refer to containers such as arrays, lists, stacks, queues etc.

Each data structure is designed to be efficient for a specific kind of problem. For example, an array (the most primitive data structure) is designed to allow fast (constant time) access to elements by index.

Similarly, if we want to store only unique elements, we would choose set instead of an array, since array allows for duplicate elements.

An array as we have learnt earlier, is of fixed length. Once an array of a particular size is declared, we cannot alter the size to add more elements dynamically.

Every programming language provides some built in support for most commonly used data structures.

The data structures that are provided in Java language, are grouped in a package called java.util, they are commonly referred as the collection framework or simply collections.

These classes which are called collections have a common root interface by the name Collection.

The implementation classes of common data structures like list, set or queue which are present in java.util package are referred as collection classes.
